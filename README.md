# ONMixture
 NMixture accompanies the San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge Rio Yaqui Fish Pond Sampling Protocol. It is fully automated, meaning that the function runs two hierarchical Bayesian random effect models. The first is an open population model that estimates population growth rate and carrying capacity. The second model estimates abundance- and detection-habitat relationships. Both tables and figures are produced and saved to a persons working directory. Those tables and figures should be included in the San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge 5 year comprehensive report(s).
