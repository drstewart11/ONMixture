Title: ONMixture: Open-population hierarchical Bayesian modeling function
Version: 0.2.8
Author: Dr. David R. Stewart
Maintainer: <david_stewart@fws.gov>
Description: ONMixture accompanies the San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge
    Rio Yaqui Fish Pond Sampling Protocol. It is fully automated, meaning that
    the function runs two hierarchical Bayesian random effect models. The first
    is an open population model that estimates population growth rate and
    carrying capacity. The second model estimates abundance- and detection-
    habitat relationships. Both tables and figures are produced and saved to
    a persons working directory. Those tables and figures should be included
    in the San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge 5 year comprehensive 
    report(s).
